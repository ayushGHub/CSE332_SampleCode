 <!-- The reason is that you’re guaranteed all of the DOM elements you may need are already present on the page.
 Loading your scripts earlier could introduce timing issues where you would need to worry about using window.onload or
 some other method to determine when the DOM is ready to be used. By including this code at the bottom of the page,
 you are assured that the DOM is ready to be poked and you won’t need to delay initialization any further. -->
